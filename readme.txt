To run the path planning simulator, just run demo.py.
This simulator requires matplotlib for visualization

Once you run the demo script, you should expect a pop up window.
From this window, you can choose to do planning in 2D or 3D
Choose one of them and click the proceed button, then just follow the GUI

Enjoy!
